
SNES on FPGA feat. Analogue Pocket


This is a port of the basic functions of the SNES(SFC) to Analogue Pocket.


* Using core.

1. Put the "Assets", "Cores" and "Platforms" in the dist on the SD card.

2. Put the rom.snes(.smc or .sfc) in the Assets/snes/common.

   Assets
      snes
         common
            rom.smc
   Cores
      pgate1.SNES
         bitstream.rbf_r
         *.json
   Platforms
      _images
         snes.bin
      snes.json

3. OK. Insert the SD card into the Pocket, turn it on, and select SNES from openFPGA.

4. There are three choices from the file browser.

   If you choose rom.snes, the game will launch.

5. Have fun until your Pocket's battery runs out.



* What to do when it doesn't work.
