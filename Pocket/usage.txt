
SNES on FPGA feat. Analogue Pocket


This is a port of the basic functions of the SNES(SFC) to Analogue Pocket.
This will allow you to load save files, but you will not be able to save yet.


* Using core.

1. Put the "Assets", "Cores" and "Platforms" in the dist on the SD card.

2. Put the rom.snes(.sfc or .smc) in the Assets/snes/common.

   Assets
      snes
         common
            rom.sfc
   Cores
      pgate1.SNES
         bitstream.rbf_r
         *.json
   Platforms
      _images
         snes.bin
      snes.json
   Saves
      snes
         common
            rom.srm (If you have a save file. Same file name as rom)

3. OK. Insert the SD card into the Pocket, turn it on, and select SNES from openFPGA.

4. There are three choices from the file browser.

   If you choose rom.snes, the game will launch.

5. Have fun until your Pocket's battery runs out.



* What to do when it doesn't work.

This is an unsupported SNES mapper.
